# Charting Covid

For today's Office Hours activity, we will be working with the charting library Chartist.js . This Library is a great resource to be able to create good looking charts quickly!
Steps:
- Clone this repo to your local machine
- Follow along with the start of office hours to discuss the Chartist object and soem of the ways we can manipulate the object
- Have fun charting!
